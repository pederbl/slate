# Errors

Customize Your Demo uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Customize Your Demo's servers.

Some 4xx errors that could be handled programmatically include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.
